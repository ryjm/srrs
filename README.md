This is the Landscape version of [Anki - powerful, intelligent flashcards](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

##### Landscape and CLI UI
![UI](srrs.gif)


on urbit: `|merge %home ~middev %kids`

from source: 

install node and npm

mount your urbit with `|mount %` in the dojo - you should see your files in unix under `/path/to/pier/home`

change `config/urbitrc-sample' to point your mounted files (`path/to/pier/home`) and rename to `urbitrc` 

install with `npm install`

run with `npm run build:dev`, and check that the `srrs` files appear under `home/app/srrs`

in the dojo, run `|commit %home` to get urbit to see the added files - you should see the added files in the output

start with `|start %srrs`

#### Usage

- start with `|start %srrs` in the dojo
- to  use `srrs-cli`, start it with `|start %srrs-cli` and `|link %srrs-cli`,
switch to it with C-x. create a private channel called `srrs` for notifications
to show up in chat.
  - tab complete for commands starting with `;`
  
##### Importing from anki

Note that this currently only supports decks with two fields, like this one: [Hoon Rune Families](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/227862017)

  - export your deck to text file and place it in your urbit pier
  - run `|commit %home`
  - run `;import-file /path/to/file/txt` from `srrs-cli`
  
##### Subscribing to other stacks

  - import stacks from other planets with the `;import [ship] [stack]` command
  - this will add shared stacks to a read-only (at least from the UI) set of
    subscribed stacks.
      - when you review an item, it will be copied to your personal stacks.
  - NOTE: all decks are currently public! permissioning to come soon. 

#### Troubleshooting

if you're having issues with the tile not showing up, run  `:launch &launch-action [%add %srrs [[%basic 'srrs' '/~srrs/srrs.png' '/~srrs'] %.y]]` in the dojo

dm `~littel-wolfur` if you're having any other issues, or create an issue here.

### Hooking into app/publish

can piggyback off of publish notebooks - title of notes are questions, bodies of
notes are answers.

put

`%+  memo  |`

in app/publish, like this:

``` hoon
...
=|  versioned-state
=*  state  -
%+  memo  |
%-  agent:dbug
^-  agent:gall
=<
  |_  bol=bowl:gall
...
```
and run `:publish +memo` - this will hook into the publish app and add all
notebooks to srrs (you need to add a new post or notebook to trigger it). 



you can also try scrying into app/publish to get the books, and then send to
srrs with a poke. better support for that path soon. 


**TODO:**
- ~~handle the scheduling of review items~~
- ~~support creating stacks/items through frontend~~
- ~~tile~~
- remove old publish artifacts (almost done)
- clean up sur and lib, move to json in mar (started)
- ~~update landscape UI to OS1 style, probably just a full rewrite~~
- less shitty
